Poshan Statistics Across District
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analysing POSHAN (Prime Minister’s Overarching Scheme for Holistic Nutrition) data across Indian districts to understand infrastructure availability, beneficiary coverage, and service delivery effectiveness.
The analysis is performed using Excel, Power Query, and Power BI to generate meaningful insights through interactive dashboards.

🧹 Data Preprocessing
The following preprocessing steps were performed before analysis:
•	Removed duplicates and handled missing values
•	Standardized district and state names
•	Converted numerical fields to appropriate data types
•	Built relationships using District Code (Data Modelling)
•	Separated Fact and Dimension tables for efficient analysis

📊 Key Analysis Performed
•	District-wise AWC infrastructure availability
•	Coverage of nutrition services (HCM & THR)
•	Age-wise child population analysis
•	Aadhaar enrolment comparison across districts
•	Performance ranking of districts
________________________________________
📈 Key Insights
•	Only 31% of AWCs have own buildings
•	36% have functional toilets and 33% have drinking water access
•	Hot Cooked Meal coverage remains low at 9%
•	Higher beneficiary concentration observed in select districts
•	Significant infrastructure gaps exist across multiple regions

📊 Types of Analysis Performed
1️⃣ Descriptive Analysis
Focuses on what is happening in the data:
•	Total number of Anganwadi Centres (AWCs)
•	Availability of infrastructure (Water, Toilets, Own Buildings)
•	Total beneficiaries: Children, Pregnant Women, Lactating Mothers
•	District-wise distribution of services
________________________________________
2️⃣ Diagnostic Analysis
Focuses on why differences exist:
•	Identification of districts with low infrastructure coverage
•	Comparison between high-performing and low-performing districts
•	Gaps between total AWCs and service-provided AWCs
•	Uneven Aadhaar enrolment across regions
________________________________________
3️⃣ Predictive Analysis
Focuses on what may happen next:
•	Identifies districts likely to face service shortfalls
•	Predicts infrastructure demand based on beneficiary volume
•	Highlights regions at risk due to low coverage trends
________________________________________
4️⃣ Prescriptive Analysis
Focuses on what actions should be taken:
•	Prioritize districts with low infrastructure coverage
•	Improve Hot Cooked Meal and THR distribution
•	Strengthen Aadhaar enrolment for better beneficiary tracking
•	Allocate resources based on district-level performance gaps

📌 Dashboard Highlights
•	KPI cards for key indicators
•	District-wise comparison charts
•	Infrastructure gap visualization
•	Beneficiary distribution analysis
